currently following the GitHub tutorial. I was not sure how important GitHub was going to be as I transition occupations. However, I clearly underestimated its weight in the IT/CSI fields. I am currently trying to immerse myself with as many prgramming languages as possible because hardware is really simple (obviously). My main source of information I am obtaining through FreeCodeCamp.org. If anyone happens to come accross this, please share your resources and stories on how to make the most of transitioning into the IT/CSI fields.
